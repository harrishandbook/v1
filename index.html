                <p>Welcome to the three most-important years of your carreer training! Out residency is growing and in 2016 increased from an eight to nine resident program with three per year. In general there are three rotations for each year. The PGY-2 resident's rotations are two months long while the PGY-3 and PGY-4 resident's have four month rotations.</p>

                <p>
                    Carve out some time to become familiar with basic exam techniques. Any exposure prior to residency is ideal, but at the least link up with a senior resident when you get into Syracuse and get to it!

                <h4 id="sec0-clinics">Clinics</h4>
                <p>General clinics are largely staffed by Dr. Alpert and Dr. Swan. Dr. Slavens staffs the Tuesday afternoon clinic and Friday afternoons are staffed by a rotation of community doc's volunteering their time. Plastics clinic is held *** Tuesday of every month and is run by an EPRS attending (Bersani, Hill, Carruth). The retina clinics are Thursday mornings and occasionally Tuesday morning. Retina clinics are staffed by the RVS attendings as well as the MVR attendings. </p>

                <h4 id="sec0-exam-rooms">Exam Rooms</h4>
                <p>
                    All rooms (including on-call Eye Room) are equiped with the standard Haagstreit Slit-lamp, indirect ophthalmoscope, Finhoff muscle light, direct ophthalmoscope, retinoscope and loose lens. You do NOT need to buy anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exam rooms all have electronic snellen charts controlled by a somewhat intuitive remote control. Mixed in the features are useful pediatric fixation videos ("Stranger in the Woods").
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="label label-info">TIP</span>Do NOT hit the wall switch! This will shut off the snellen chart which is a pain to reboot.

                <h3 id="sec0-encounter">Patient Encounter</h3>
                <p>There are a number of clicks that need to be completed in order for your attending to sign your note. This process can be time consuming and it is recomended you develop a work-flow early on and stick to that process. Although some attendings are okay with signing notes at a later date, it is best to get in the habit of finishing notes during the visit. Completing patient encounters as they come allows your attending to attest the note while they are still fresh. If you are behind it is important to know that the examination documentation, follow-up and after visit summary (AVS) must be completed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assign yourself the patient:</strong> Right-click patient on general clinic schedule and assign patient to yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review PMH:</strong> Click “Rooming” tab and after the PMH section click “Reviewed”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review Meds/All/FHx:</strong> Click “Plan” tab and after the meds/allergies and family history box click “Reviewed”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create note:</strong> Use the “OPHPROGRESS” smart-phrase. This should auto-populate the CC/HPI from intake however if this is not completed you will will have to do it yourself in the “rooming” tab.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete your exam:</strong> In the “Ophtho Exam” tab (this is also where the intake refraction and IOP can be found. Once you have completed the exam click out of the exam tab, then click the “refresh” button on your note and it will auto-populate in. Otherwise this info is not saved within your note (not lost but not communicated forward).</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete your imaging:</strong> The following steps must be completed in order for Alpert or Swan to sign off on these.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Order</strong> the test from the "Plan" tab and only sign the order to Alpert or Swan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Release</strong> the order from under the "Order Review" tab (often completed by technician's)</li>
                            <li><strong>Route</strong> the test to Alpert, Swan and Vision pool for interpretation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpret</strong> the test under the "img/proc" tab and click "Preliminary"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Complete your note:</strong> Finish the Assessment/Plan then present the patient to your attending. Select "Share on closing", do NOT sign these notes. This is different from on-call notes coverred later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Present to the attending:</strong> Don't forget to establish the plan and follow-up (include all steps in your A/P)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pyxis Rx and MAR:</strong> When ordering meds administered at the time of visit, be sure to select the clinic administered order type (small graphic of hospital bed). After you document ordering the meds you have to document delivery of the meds under the "MAR" tab. This is only necessary for meds removed from the Pyxis. (Lot# required for injections)</li>
                    <li><strong>Enter Follow-up:</strong> Click “wrap-up” tab. This is where you enter the follow-up info (must be typed in the box) for the patient. Include Clinic and time (ie. Retina 1 month).</li>
                    <li><strong>After visit summary (AVS):</strong> This will be printed for the patient to leave with. Always use the "OPHAVS" smartphrase and include pertinent instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select visit diagnosis:</strong> Under the "Plan" tab. Prior diagnosis from the problem list can be pulled into your visit by selecting the PL option to the right. Additionally a "Previous" menu sits next to the visit diagnosis text field.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code visit:</strong> E3 under the attending for clinic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Route to your attending</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Check "Sign visit" tab:</strong> Click the "Sign Visit" tab to see all outstanding steps. Once you have completed your steps there should be two items that require completion (your note is "incomplete" because it was shared and not signed). Any additional flags need be addressed otherwise your attending will not be able to sign/complete the note without clicking through through them which is our job, not theirs.</li>

                    <h3 id="sec0-plastics">PGY-2 Plastics Guide</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have the privilege of working with the Eye Plastics and Reconstructive Surgeons (EPRS). The group was started by Dr. Thomas Bersani who was later joined by two SUNY Upstate Ophthalmology residency graduates, Dr. Robert Hill and Dr. Bryant Carruth. They generously provide the residents with a two Tuesday’s per month as well as occasional OR time at there private ASC. In general, one Tuesday is designated for surgery and the other is for clinic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The PGY-2 resident at 550 is the designated plastics resident who scrubs in with the EPRS attending and is responsible for the perioperative visits. Every effort should be made to have the operating resident present during the pre-op visit where the surgical planning is out-lined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the first surgical rotation of our residency and is our first impression as surgeons. You responsible for a thorough patient history and understanding of the indicated procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The oculoplastic fellowship application process occurs largely during the PGY-3 year of residency. If you feel drawn to this field, take advantage of the rotation and discuss what steps need to be taken with the EPRS attending’s.

                    <h4 class="arh-under">1. Pre-op Visit</h4>
                    <p>Patients selected for surgery have a visit in the Oculoplastics Clinic staffed by one of the plastics attending prior to being signed up for surgery. May require additional pre-op visit in separate clinic. If the patient is seen by another resident, you should be asked to meet the patient and complete the Pre-Op note. Occasionally, the pre-op note is not completed prior to the day of surgery and will need to be done the morning of surgery. Cases are eligible to be performed at the Vickery Surgery Center now and should have additional paperwork completed by nursing staff. Consider scheduling at Vickery if – minimal co-morbidities (low anesthesia risk), English speaking, insurance (determined by the scheduler). The pre-op exam should include heart and lungs (yes you will use a stethoscope - found in bottom drawer of all exam rooms).
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="arh-under">2. Call the patient</h4>
                    <p>Should be called the week before the procedure, however if patient is on blood-thinners should call two weeks before if plan is to hold them.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm surgery, identify any interval health issues or hospitalizations</li>

                    <p>Should contact the attending the week prior to the surgery date (Thursday or Friday is acceptable). This is when you will present the patients and quickly review the cases.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brief case presentation and an opportunity to ask any questions you may have.</li>

                        Find the patient in the pre-op area. Once the consent is completed it will need to be signed the the attending and left with the nurse in pre-op, otherwise patient will not be allowed back to the OR.

                    <h4 class="arh-under">1. Brief Op Note</h4>
                    <p>This should be completed immediately following your surgery. The note documents information that would be important if the patient were to develop any immediate post-op complications prior to completion of the full/detailed operative note. The note largely auto-populates itself however be sure to confirm the surgery performed as this is auto-populated by the nurse note.</p>

                    <p>Needs to be completed prior to starting your next case otherwise the patient will be stuck in the post-op area until you are done. Click through and complete the “Discharge Orders” tab.</p>

                    <h4 class="arh-under">3. Operative Note</h4>
                    <p>Should be completed by the end of the day preferably prior to the attending leaving as he will need to co-sign the note. There copies of notes from previous common procedures (i.e. DCR, ptosis repair, etc) in the filing cabinet under the chief’s desk. Ask about shared smart phrases too. Occasionally the attending will dictate the note in-which case you will not need to complete this step.</p>

                    <h4 class="arh-under">4. Post-op Plan</h4>
                    <p>You are this patients surgeon and need to know the next step. If tubes were placed, you need to know if they were sutured in-place, if it needs to be removed from the punctum or the nares, etc. <b>Clarify follow-up plan and next step for the paient at conclusion of your case.</b> A good time to ask is while your are closing up the case because once the patient leaves the OR you have notes to write and the next patient to prep.</p>

                <h4>The Schedule</h4>
                <p>There are some exciting changes in the call schedule (as of 2016). Classically the PGY-2's covered 8 nights of call per resident. The PGY-3's were responsible for the remainder of calls and were only responsible for one Friday-Sunday weekend (can be split up). Starting in 2016, the schedule was changed to a where the PGY-3's are now responsible for three nights each and the reaminder is left to the PGY-2's to cover. This drops the average call load per month to approximately seven. If agreeable, the up-coming classes may continue this change until the call is split equally between the PGY-2 and PGY-3 years.</p>

                <h4 id="sec2-follow">On-Call follow-up and billing:</h4>
                <p>All patients seen or addressed need to be accounted for. This includes all patients seen in the ED or referred by the ED (you will be called for a clinic appointment). All patients at upstate have contact information in Epic, however this is not the case for Crouse. You need to record the following for all patients seen at Crouse or called for follow-up from Crouse.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Full name</li>
                    <li>Date of Birth</li>
                    <li>Patient Contact number (nursing staff does NOT have access to Crouse EMR)</li>
                    <li>Name of requesting provider</li>
                </ol>
                <p><span class="label label-info">TIP</span> Always collect a patient facesheet to leave on the clipboard with your Crouse consult notes.</p>
                <p>At the 550 clinic there is a three clipboard system for all patients seen in Crouse or Upstate. This ensures reimbursement for our efforts and relays information to nurses for follow-up. Follow-up scheduling is handled at the start of every day to ensure patients who need to be seen that day can be. This makes the clipboard a priority prior to the morning lectures but does NOT excuse you from lecture. The clipboards and excel sheets should be updated by 8:00AM every weekday.</p>
                <h5>Follow-up Clipboards and Spreadsheet:</h5>
                <p>Clipboards found on back of the 550 Harrison resident office room door. Excel sheets are found on the Eye Drive.</p>
                <div class="list-group">

                <h4 id="sec2-sign">Resident Sign-out</h4>
                <p>All new in-patients need to be added to shared in-patient list in epic and require a verbal/text sign-out to in-patient resident - If on call Friday, Saturday or Sunday it is your responsibility to communicate with the in-patient resident prior to Monday morning conference.</p>
                <h4>General Phone-Call Guidelines</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do NOT offer advice over the phone. They will write in their note, “discussed with Dr. Whoops from Ophthalmology…” and now you are liable for the well-being of that patient.</li>
                    <li>Always collect a Name, DOB/MRN and Contact number (Crouse Patients) to ensure appropriate follow-up.</li>
                    <li>Phone calls from the call-center for post-op pain management are common. If still in-patient can agree with whatever the nurse feels is appropriate (within reason guys). We do NOT write for narcotics or tetracaine drops.</li>
                </ul>



                <h4 id="sec2-walk">Walk-through of an UH consult...</h4>
                <p>You get paged, now you have 15min to call the number back (see quick references) and collect the information you need to find the patient (Don’t waste time on their history b/c majority of the time you’re called to figure something that their history has not yet determined).</p>
                <p>Now you have 1 hour to see the patient so don't waste time just head straight into the Upstate eye room.</p>
                <p>First stop you make is the eye-room on the first floor of Upstate Hospital, rm 1409. Use the handle once to power the electronic lock then type 525300 and open sesame.</p>
                <p>Grab a call bag and check that all drops needed are there. (ie. tetracaine, tropicamide, phenylephrine, fluorescein are a minimum). Now grab the 3-pieces of gear that require charging...

                <p>
                    Start with basics, VA, Pupils (APD?), EOMS, VF, tonometry, color plates (if situation calls for them).
                    <br><span class="label label-info">TIP</span> <i>If you forgot to check VA prior to dilating, although not ideal you can still check using a +3.00D loose-lens with the near card and there is always the pinhole occluder.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After basic exam is complete AND your senior has given the go-ahead you can then dilate. Eventually you will dilate on your own but don’t expect to within the first week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dilation may be contra-indicated in neuro or trauma patients where pupil checks serve as the only marker of intracranial change. In general we assume all consults are for a complete dilated exam, however it is important to double check with the primary team prior to dilating any neuro, trauma or non-verbal patients. Often times dilation is permitted, do NOT defer dilation based on neuro-checks alone.</p>
                <p>From an ophthalmic standpoint, you should be able to identify those at risk for dilation induced acute angle-closure glaucoma. In general, concern for any potential blinding process that requires a dilated evaluation trumps the theoretical risk of this rare condition.
                    <br><span class="label label-info">TIP</span> <i>AACG is a rare condition and knowing the demographic helps to expedite your exam. Generally those at risk are elderly, white, phakic, hyperopic women. Check a Von Herricks if concerned. Great teaching video on <a href="www.gonioscopy.org.">gonioscopy.org</a>.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dilating takes 15-20min so you can start your note or move to the next consult if needed. Once dilated, check your DFE and formulate a plan. Counsel the patient accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find the resident covering the patient and convey your recommendations. Let them know all drops or imaging that will need to be ordered for the patient. If imaging is needed you must follow this up or pass on to the next resident who will be on-call when the test is completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now your done. You saw your patients and returned to the eye-room to put everything back on their chargers and 8AM rolls around. All in-patients that need to be rounded on need to be signed out to the in-patient resident (on your call schedule). All consults and calls need to be put on the clipboards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is Friday or Saturday, all in-patients and eye-room follow-ups need to be signed out to the resident coming on that day.
                    <br>
                    <span class="label label-info">NOTE</span> Avoid taking patients to eye-room alone, there is a slit-lamp available in all ED’s.

                <!-- RUPTURED GLOBE PROTOCOL -->
                <h2 id="sec3" class="underline">Ruptured Globe Guide</h2>
                <p>Ruptured globes (RG) are injuries that compromise the corneoscleral integrity and have a high risk for infection and vision loss. If suspected, they require surgical exploration and repair in the OR. It is our department’s preference to perform the repair in the Crouse Hospital operating room (not Upstate). RG patients presenting to the University Hospital ED will require a number of steps to transfer the patient to Crouse Hospital for the surgery and possibly back to Upstate for the post-op care. If RG is suspected, you should contact your senior and follow the steps below (steps listed in the relative order of which they should be completed).</p>

                <div class="well well-sm text-center">You finished examining a suspected ruptured globe...</div>
                <h4>1. Write your consult</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Include dilated exam of fellow eye and document last time the patient ate/drank for anesthesia.</li>
                    <li>Plan should include post-op care instructions, use smart phrase, “OPHRUPTUREDGLOBE” - Keep shield on, no eye drops in RG eye, no bending/lifting/straining, out of bed with assistance, anti-emetics for nausea, pain control per primary team, update tetanus, IV antibiotics (see Will’s: Ancef and Cipro).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Rally the troops</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Call your senior who will examine the patient</li>
                    <li>Call your attending</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>3. Talk to primary team to place orders</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Labs (BMP, CBC, PT/INR, PTT), EKG (if patient over 50 years old).</li>
                    <li>Update Tetanus, Anti-emetic PRN, NPO order and Eye shield.</li>
                    <li>Start IV Antibiotics (refer to Will’s Eye Manual) …make sure they are started/hung prior to transfer.</li>
                    <li>CT Orbits - stat (make sure completed prior to transfer).</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4 class="text-center">ORBITAL TRAUMA PROTOCOL: CROUSE HOSPITAL</h4>

                    <p><u>Departments:</u> Emergency Medicine, Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology</p>
                    <p><u>Goal:</u> To assure care coordination for patients presenting to the Crouse Emergency Department with facial trauma complicated by possible orbital fractures. </p>
                    <p><u>Background:</u> Patients who suffer facial injuries frequently sustain fractures of the orbital bones. These fractures can be subdivided broadly into those that are confined to the orbital floor and/or medial wall (“floor fractures”) and those that extend further to the orbital rim or beyond (“rim fractures”). Orbital contents such as fat, extra ocular muscles, the optic nerve and the eye itself are also at risk for damage in these injuries. Likewise, adjacent structures such as the paranasal sinuses, skull base, orbital roof, zygomatic arch, mandible, and all the associated soft tissues may also be involved. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to assess the extent of injury and plan effective treatment. Evaluation by Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology is needed in all such cases. Occasionally, other services such as Neurosurgery may need to participate as well.</p>
                    <p>The initial assessment of these patients takes place in the Emergency Department but surgical treatment is often deferred, since many orbital fractures can be successfully managed conservatively. Careful coordination among the various sub-specialists is needed to optimize patient care after the acute injury.</p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Policy:</u>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When a patient presents with facial trauma and initial assessment by the Emergency Department, including appropriate imaging studies, results in the diagnosis of an orbital fracture,<b><i> the ED medical staff will decide if immediate consultation is required. This decision should include discussion among the relevant services, including radiology, as needed. If there is such a need for immediate consultation, to further evaluate and establish appropriate management of the patient’s injuries, both the Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology services will be asked to see the patient. </i></b></li>
                            <li>Evaluation of the patient and review of the imaging studies will be conducted by both consulting services to determine the extent of orbital fracture and any other associated injuries. Input from the Attending Radiologist should be sought as needed.</li>
                            <li>If the fracture is limited to the orbital floor/medial wall with no other injury relevant to Otolaryngology, and urgent surgery is not indicated, the Otolaryngology service will sign off on the case and arrangements will be made for outpatient followup by the Ophthalmology service. If delayed surgical repair of the fracture is ultimately necessary, the Ophthalmology service will refer to Oculoplastics or to an appropriate Otolaryngology surgical subspecialist as needed.</li>
                            <li>If the fracture involves the orbital rim, is accompanied by urgent surgical indications or if there are other surgical otolaryngologic injuries, arrangements will be made for timely treatment by the Otolaryngology service. These arrangements may include transfer to Upstate Medical University Hospital if the necessary surgical care cannot be provided at Crouse Hospital due to a lack of the necessary surgical subspecialists, facilities or equipment. Further outpatient ophthalmologic followup can be arranged as needed.</li>
                            <li>In the event of more extensive injuries, additional consultation (eg: Neurosurgery, Oral Surgery, etc.) will be requested as needed at the discretion of the Emergency Department physician or the other consultants also caring for the patient.</li>
                            <li>In no instance will a patient with an orbital fracture be discharged from the Emergency Department without clear input and agreement among the consultants as to necessary acute and followup care.</li>
                            <li>If no fracture is present but other injuries suggest the need for one or more consultations, such will be obtained at the discretion of the Emergency Department physician according to customary practice.</li>
